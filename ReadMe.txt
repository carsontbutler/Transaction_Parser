Transaction Report Parser

This is a tool I developed that parses financial transaction data and makes it more readable for help desk agents in a call center.

Agents on the help desk were required to read through a report of financial transactions to pick out error codes seen on the unit they were troubleshooting. This was vital to their troubleshooting, but it was time consuming, and it sometimes led to increased call times.

The goal of the application was to speed up this process by creating visual representations of the data. The application filters out any irrelevant text and puts all error codes into graphs. The graphs show the frequency of each error, which device had the error, and other relevant information such as timestamp and transaction type.

Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Javascript, ChartJs, Bootstrap

How to use:
1. Download the sample transaction text file from this repo - "Transaction Report (sample).txt"
2. Open the application: (link)
3. Select Browse, find the downloaded text file, then select "Show Results"
